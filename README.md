# Bayesian SEM and CFA guides

This is a guide on Bayesian SEM using R and Stan, I authored this while leading workshops for the Center for Research Methods and Data Analysis while at the University of Kansas.

I recently added the CFA guide to this repo as well. I think the two go well together. The CFA R script that pairs with this relies on 3gb of data and is thus too heavy to host here. 

For the slides check out the pdf, sem-5-4-bayes_sem.pdf
To run the examples checkout sem-5-4-bayes_sem.R
